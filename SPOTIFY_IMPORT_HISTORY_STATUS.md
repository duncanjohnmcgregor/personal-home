The Import From Spotify page already includes a comprehensive history tracking system that stores and displays all playlist import activities.

### 2. API Endpoints

### 3. User Interface

#### Location: `/dashboard/import/spotify`
The Import From Spotify page has three tabs:

1. **Your Playlists**: Browse and select Spotify playlists to import
2. **Current Import**: View real-time progress of ongoing imports
3. **Previous Imports**: View complete history of past imports ✅

#### History Features:

### 4. Import Process Integration

The import process automatically:
