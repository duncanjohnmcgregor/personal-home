# Spotify Playlist Import Implementation

## Overview
Successfully implemented the Spotify Playlist Import feature (Task 3.1) with the following components:

## Components Created

- Fetches and displays user's Spotify playlists
- Supports pagination for users with many playlists
- Allows single or bulk selection of playlists
- Shows real-time import progress
- Handles errors gracefully

### 2. Import API Route (`src/app/api/spotify/import/route.ts`)
- Authenticates user session
- Fetches playlist details from Spotify
- Handles playlist pagination to get all tracks
- Creates or updates playlists in database
- Imports songs with deduplication
- Returns import statistics

### 3. UI Components
- **Checkbox Component** (`src/components/ui/checkbox.tsx`)
  - Radix UI based checkbox for playlist selection
  
- **Progress Component** (`src/components/ui/progress.tsx`)
  - Visual progress indicator for import status

- **Import Wizard** (`src/components/playlist/import-wizard.tsx`)
  - Step-by-step import visualization (optional enhancement)
