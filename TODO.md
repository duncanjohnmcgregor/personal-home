## Development Guidelines

### Parallel Development Strategy
1. **DevOps Infrastructure Priority**: Complete 1.2 (DevOps & Automated Deployment Infrastructure) early to enable safe, automated deployments throughout development
2. **Independent Work Items**: Tasks marked "Can be worked on in parallel: Yes" can be developed simultaneously
3. **Foundation First**: Complete Phase 1 before moving to dependent tasks
4. **Feature Branches**: Use feature branches for each TODO item with automated CI/CD validation
5. **API-First Development**: Complete API routes before frontend components

### Code Quality Standards
- Follow TypeScript strict mode
- Use ESLint and Prettier for code formatting
- Write JSDoc comments for all functions
- Implement proper error handling
- Follow React best practices (hooks, context, etc.)

### Testing Strategy
- Write tests alongside feature development
- Minimum 80% code coverage target
- Test all API endpoints
- Test critical user flows end-to-end

### Documentation Requirements
- Update README.md with setup instructions
- Document API endpoints with examples
- Create component documentation with Storybook
- Maintain deployment documentation

## Estimated Total Development Time
- **Phase 1-3 (Core Features + DevOps Infrastructure)**: 30-42 hours
- **Phase 4-5 (Multi-platform)**: 20-25 hours  
- **Phase 6 (Advanced Features)**: 23-28 hours
- **Phase 7 (Testing & Optimization)**: 13-17 hours
- **Phase 8 (Advanced DevOps)**: 10-13 hours
- **Total**: 96-125 hours

## Notes for Cursor Agents
- Always check dependencies before starting a task
- Update this TODO with progress (mark completed items with ✅)
- Add any discovered sub-tasks or issues to the relevant section
- Coordinate with other agents to avoid conflicts on shared files
- Test thoroughly before marking items complete
