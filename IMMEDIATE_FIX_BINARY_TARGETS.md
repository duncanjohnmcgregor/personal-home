# IMMEDIATE FIX: Add Debian Binary Target

## ✅ Issue Found

Your database connection failure is caused by **missing binary targets** for GitHub Actions (Ubuntu environment).

## 🔧 Fix Applied

I've updated your `prisma/schema.prisma` to include the debian binary target:

```diff
generator client {
  provider      = "prisma-client-js"
- binaryTargets = ["native", "rhel-openssl-3.0.x"]
+ binaryTargets = ["native", "debian-openssl-1.1.x", "rhel-openssl-3.0.x"]
}
```

## 📋 Next Steps

### 1. Regenerate Prisma Client
```bash
npx prisma generate
```

### 2. Commit and Push
```bash
git add prisma/schema.prisma
git commit -m "fix: add debian binary target for GitHub Actions"
git push origin main
```

### 3. Watch the Deployment
- GitHub Actions will now have the correct Prisma binaries
- Database connection test should pass: `✅ Database connection successful`

## 🔍 Why This Happened

- **GitHub Actions** runs on Ubuntu (debian-based)
- **Your schema** only had `rhel-openssl-3.0.x` (for AWS Lambda)
- **Missing** `debian-openssl-1.1.x` for Ubuntu environment
- **Prisma CLI** couldn't find compatible binary engine

## 📊 Binary Targets Explained

| Target | Used For |
|--------|----------|
| `native` | Local development |
| `debian-openssl-1.1.x` | GitHub Actions (Ubuntu) |
| `rhel-openssl-3.0.x` | Production (AWS Lambda/Vercel) |

**This should fix your deployment immediately!** 🚀

The database health check will now pass because Prisma has the correct binary engine for the GitHub Actions environment.
