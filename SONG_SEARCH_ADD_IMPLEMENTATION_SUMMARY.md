## üèóÔ∏è Technical Architecture

### API Layer
```
/api/search (Unified)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ /api/spotify/search
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ /api/soundcloud/search
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ /api/beatport/search
```

### Component Structure
```
src/components/search/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ search-input.tsx      # Smart search input with filters
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ search-results.tsx    # Results display with actions
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ add-songs-dialog.tsx  # Main dialog component
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ index.ts             # Component exports
```

### Hook Integration
```
src/lib/hooks/
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ use-search.ts        # Search state management hook
```

### Data Flow
1. User types in search input (debounced)
