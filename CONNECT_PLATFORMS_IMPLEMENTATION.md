- Consistent with existing dashboard layout

### Technical Implementation
- **Framework**: Next.js 14 with App Router
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with custom components
- **Authentication**: NextAuth.js integration
- **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript implementation
- **Build Status**: ✅ Successfully builds without errors

### Future Enhancements Ready
The implementation is prepared for future OAuth integration:
- Platform connection handlers are stubbed
- Database schema already supports Beatport and SoundCloud IDs
- API structure is planned in the project roadmap
- Environment variables are documented for API credentials

### Files Modified/Created
1. `src/app/dashboard/connect/page.tsx` - Main page component
2. `src/components/ui/badge.tsx` - New Badge component
3. `src/components/ui/index.ts` - Updated exports
4. `CONNECT_PLATFORMS_IMPLEMENTATION.md` - This documentation

### Testing

- ✅ TypeScript compilation successful
- ✅ ESLint validation passed
- ✅ Page renders correctly in development mode
- ✅ Navigation integration working

The Connect Platforms page is now fully functional and ready for users to view available platform connection options. When the OAuth integrations for Beatport and SoundCloud are implemented, the "Coming Soon" badges can be removed and the connection buttons will be functional.
