- **Toast Integration**: Uses existing toast system for user feedback

## Technical Implementation Details

### Import Process Flow
1. **Playlist Fetching**: Uses existing Spotify API integration to fetch user playlists
2. **Selection Interface**: Users can search, filter, and select multiple playlists
3. **Bulk Import**: Imports playlists sequentially to avoid API rate limiting
4. **Track Processing**: For each playlist:
   - Fetches tracks in batches of 100
   - Creates playlist in local database
   - Imports each track (creates song if not exists)
   - Links tracks to playlist with position
   - Updates progress in real-time

### Database Integration
- **Playlist Storage**: Creates playlists with Spotify ID for sync tracking
- **Song Management**: Handles duplicate songs across playlists
- **Relationship Mapping**: Maintains playlist-song relationships with positions

### Error Handling
- **API Failures**: Graceful handling of Spotify API errors
- **Rate Limiting**: Built-in delays between requests
- **Partial Failures**: Continues import even if individual tracks fail
- **User Feedback**: Clear error messages and status updates

### Performance Optimizations
- **Batch Processing**: Fetches tracks in optimal batch sizes
- **Sequential Processing**: Prevents API overload
- **Progress Updates**: Real-time UI updates without blocking
- **Memory Management**: Efficient handling of large playlists

## User Experience Features

### Search and Filtering
- Real-time search across playlist names, descriptions, and owners
- Case-insensitive search

### Progress Tracking
- Two-tab interface: selection and progress
- Real-time progress bars
- Status indicators with icons
- Error reporting for failed imports

### Responsive Design
- Works on desktop and mobile devices
- Grid layout adapts to screen size
- Touch-friendly interface elements

## Integration with Existing System

### Navigation
- Added to dashboard sidebar as "Import from Spotify"
- Follows existing navigation patterns
- Consistent with application design

### Authentication
- Uses existing NextAuth.js integration
- Leverages Spotify OAuth tokens
- Automatic token refresh handling

### Database Schema
