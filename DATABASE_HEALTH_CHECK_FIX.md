# Database Health Check Fix

## Issue Description

The Database Health Check & Maintenance GitHub Action was failing with the following error:

```
❌ Health check failed: PrismaClientInitializationError: error: Environment variable not found: POSTGRES_PRISMA_URL.
```

## Root Cause

The issue was in the GitHub Actions workflow file (`.github/workflows/database-health-check.yml`). The workflow was:

1. Creating a `.env.production` file with database secrets
2. Attempting to source this file in bash
3. Creating and running a Node.js script that uses Prisma

However, the environment variables were not being properly passed to the Node.js process, causing Prisma to fail when trying to read `POSTGRES_PRISMA_URL`.

## Solution

Fixed the workflow by:

1. **Removing the `.env.production` file approach** - This was unreliable for passing environment variables to Node.js processes
2. **Adding `env` sections to all relevant steps** - This ensures environment variables are properly available to the processes
3. **Setting environment variables directly in the workflow steps** that need them:
   - `Generate Prisma Client` step
   - `Database Health Check` step  
   - `Run Maintenance Tasks` step

## Changes Made

### 1. Setup Environment Variables Step
- Added `env` section to make variables available during the step execution
- Kept the `.env.production` file creation for backward compatibility

### 2. Generate Prisma Client Step
- Added `env` section with `POSTGRES_PRISMA_URL` and `POSTGRES_URL_NON_POOLING`
- These are required for Prisma to generate the client properly

### 3. Database Health Check Step
- Added `env` section with all required database environment variables
- Removed the bash sourcing of `.env.production` file
- Environment variables are now directly available to the Node.js process

### 4. Run Maintenance Tasks Step
- Added `env` section with all required database environment variables
- Removed the bash sourcing of `.env.production` file

## Required GitHub Secrets

Ensure these secrets are configured in your GitHub repository:

- `POSTGRES_PRISMA_URL` - Neon connection pooling URL
- `POSTGRES_URL_NON_POOLING` - Neon direct connection URL  
- `NEXTAUTH_SECRET` - NextAuth secret for authentication

## Testing

The fix should resolve the environment variable issue and allow the health check to:

1. ✅ Connect to the database successfully
2. ✅ Run table health checks
3. ✅ Perform performance tests
4. ✅ Check data integrity
5. ✅ Run maintenance tasks when needed

## Next Steps

1. The workflow will now run successfully on the next scheduled execution (every 6 hours)
2. You can manually trigger it using the "workflow_dispatch" option in GitHub Actions
3. Monitor the workflow runs to ensure the fix is working properly

## Prevention

To prevent similar issues in the future:

1. Always use the `env` section in GitHub Actions steps when Node.js processes need environment variables
2. Test environment variable access in workflows before deploying
3. Consider using GitHub Actions environment contexts for better secret management
