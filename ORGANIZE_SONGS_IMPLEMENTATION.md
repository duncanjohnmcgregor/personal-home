- Confirmation dialogs for destructive operations
- Toast notifications for user feedback
- Responsive design for mobile and desktop

### Technical Implementation
- Maintained existing API integration patterns
- Preserved undo/redo functionality
- Error handling and loading states
- TypeScript type safety
- Consistent with existing component architecture

## Benefits

1. **More Focused Functionality**: Users can now directly organize songs within their playlists
2. **Enhanced Productivity**: Bulk operations and advanced sorting save time
3. **Better Song Management**: Search and filter capabilities make finding specific songs easier
4. **Cross-Playlist Organization**: Ability to move songs between playlists
5. **Maintained Workflow**: Undo/redo functionality preserves user confidence

## Future Enhancements

1. **Drag & Drop Reordering**: Visual drag-and-drop interface for song reordering
2. **Smart Playlists**: Automatic organization based on BPM, genre, or other criteria
3. **Duplicate Detection**: Identify and manage duplicate songs across playlists
4. **Batch Import**: Import songs from multiple sources into selected playlists
5. **Playlist Analytics**: Statistics about song distribution and playlist health

## API Requirements

The implementation assumes the following API endpoints exist:
- `reorderPlaylistSongs(playlistId, { songIds })`: Reorder songs within a playlist
- `removeSongFromPlaylist(playlistId, { songId })`: Remove a song from a playlist
- `addSongToPlaylist(playlistId, { songId })`: Add a song to a playlist (for bulk move operations)

## Testing Recommendations

1. Test playlist selection and song loading
2. Verify search and sorting functionality
3. Test bulk selection and operations
4. Validate cross-playlist song movement
5. Ensure undo/redo works with all operations
6. Test responsive design on mobile devices
7. Verify error handling for failed operations
