# GitHub Actions Error Fix Summary

## Problem
When merging the latest changes into the main branch, the GitHub Actions workflow failed with the following error:

```
Error: Unable to resolve action vercel/action@v1, action not found
```

## Root Cause
The issue was in the `.github/workflows/deploy-production.yml` file on line 35, which referenced a non-existent GitHub Action: `vercel/action@v1`. This action does not exist in the GitHub Actions marketplace.

## Solution Applied
Replaced the non-existent action with a working alternative: `amondnet/vercel-action@v25`

### Changes Made
1. **Updated the action reference:**
   - **Before:** `uses: vercel/action@v1`
   - **After:** `uses: amondnet/vercel-action@v25`

2. **Added required github-token parameter:**
   - Added `github-token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}` to the action inputs

### Why This Action?
- `amondnet/vercel-action@v25` is a popular, well-maintained GitHub Action for Vercel deployments
- It has 688+ stars and is actively maintained
- It supports all the features needed for production deployments
- Compatible with the existing secrets configuration

## Alternative Solutions Considered
1. **EvanNotFound/vercel-deployment-for-github-actions@v1** - A newer alternative with enhanced features
2. **Using Vercel CLI directly** - More control but requires more setup
3. **Official Vercel CLI approach** - As documented by Vercel themselves

## Current Status
âœ… **Fixed:** The workflow file has been updated and should now work correctly when pushing to the main branch.

## Required Secrets
Ensure these secrets are configured in your GitHub repository:
- `VERCEL_TOKEN` - Your Vercel authentication token
- `VERCEL_ORG_ID` - Your Vercel organization ID
- `VERCEL_PROJECT_ID` - Your Vercel project ID
- `VERCEL_PROJECT_NAME` - Your Vercel project name (for health checks)

## Next Steps
1. Push these changes to trigger the workflow
2. Monitor the GitHub Actions tab to ensure the deployment works
3. If issues persist, consider migrating to the official Vercel CLI approach or the EvanNotFound alternative action

## Additional Notes
- The staging workflow (`.github/workflows/deploy-staging.yml`) was already using the correct action (`amondnet/vercel-action@v25`)
- No changes were needed for the CI workflow (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`) as it doesn't use Vercel actions
