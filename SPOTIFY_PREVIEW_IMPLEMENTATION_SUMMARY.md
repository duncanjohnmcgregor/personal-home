# Spotify Song Preview Implementation Summary

## Overview
Successfully implemented Spotify song preview functionality for playlists. When viewing songs within a playlist, users can now play 30-second preview clips directly in the interface using a dedicated preview button.

## Key Components Implemented

### 1. Audio Player Hook (`src/lib/hooks/use-audio-player.ts`)
- **Purpose**: Custom React hook for managing HTML5 audio playback
- **Features**:
  - Play/pause/stop controls
  - Volume control
  - Seek functionality
  - Current time and duration tracking
  - Loading states and error handling
  - Automatic cleanup on unmount

### 2. Preview Player Context (`src/lib/contexts/preview-player-context.tsx`)
- **Purpose**: Global state management for preview playback
- **Features**:
  - Ensures only one preview plays at a time
  - Manages currently playing song ID
  - Provides play/pause/stop controls across components
  - Handles track switching automatically

### 3. Enhanced Song Item Component (`src/components/playlist/song-item.tsx`)
- **Purpose**: Individual song component with preview functionality
- **New Features**:
  - Preview button (Volume2 icon) appears on hover
  - Toggles between play and pause states
  - Shows loading state during audio loading
  - Error handling for failed audio loads
  - Only shows preview button for songs with available preview URLs

### 4. Updated Song List Component (`src/components/playlist/song-list.tsx`)
- **Purpose**: Container for multiple song items
- **New Features**:
  - Added `showPreviewButtons` prop (defaults to true)
  - Passes preview button visibility to child components

## Data Flow

### Preview URL Storage
- Spotify preview URLs are already being saved during playlist import
- Located in the `Song` model's `previewUrl` field in the database
- Import process correctly maps Spotify's `preview_url` to local `previewUrl`

### Audio Playback Flow
1. User clicks preview button on a song
2. Component checks if preview URL exists
3. If playing, pauses current audio
4. If not playing, creates new Audio element with preview URL
5. Plays 30-second preview clip
6. Updates UI state to show pause button
7. Automatically resets when audio ends

## Technical Implementation Details

### Audio Management
- Uses HTML5 Audio API for cross-browser compatibility
- Simple audio element creation and management
- Automatic cleanup when audio ends or errors occur
- Prevents multiple simultaneous previews by stopping existing audio
- Fixed volume level of 0.7 (70%) for consistent experience

### State Management
- Local component state for simple preview playback
- Uses DOM queries to manage global audio state
- Prevents multiple simultaneous previews across all components
- Unique data attribute for identifying active preview audio

### UI/UX Features
- Preview button only visible on hover to reduce clutter
- Clear visual indication of playing/paused state
- Consistent with existing playlist interface design
- Error states handled gracefully

## File Changes Made

### New Files
1. `SPOTIFY_PREVIEW_IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md` - This documentation

### Modified Files
1. `src/components/playlist/song-item.tsx` - Added preview functionality
2. `src/components/playlist/song-list.tsx` - Added preview button prop

## Usage Instructions

### For Users
1. Navigate to any playlist with Spotify songs
2. Hover over a song row to see the preview button (Volume2 icon)
3. Click the preview button to play a 30-second preview
4. Click again to pause or click another song's preview to switch
5. Preview automatically stops after 30 seconds

### For Developers
1. Preview buttons are enabled by default in playlist views
2. To disable: pass `showPreviewButtons={false}` to `SongList` component
3. Preview URLs are automatically available for imported Spotify songs
4. Simple DOM-based audio management ensures only one preview plays at a time

## Browser Compatibility
- Supports all modern browsers with HTML5 Audio API
- Graceful fallback for browsers without audio support
- Handles various audio format limitations

## Performance Considerations
- Audio elements created on-demand to minimize memory usage
- Automatic cleanup prevents audio resource leaks
- Minimal impact on page load times
- Preview URLs cached by Spotify CDN

## Future Enhancements
- Visual progress bar for preview playback
- Cross-fade between preview tracks
- Integration with full-featured music player
- Preview volume control
- Keyboard shortcuts for preview controls

## Testing Recommendations
1. Test with various Spotify songs (some may not have previews)
2. Verify audio cleanup when navigating away from playlists
3. Test multiple simultaneous preview attempts
4. Check behavior on mobile devices
5. Verify with poor network conditions

## Spotify API Integration
- Preview URLs are fetched during playlist import
- 30-second preview clips provided by Spotify
- No additional API calls required for preview playback
- Respects Spotify's usage policies for preview content
